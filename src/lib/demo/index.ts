    title: "Porter's Five Forces — Complete Guide", topic: "Porter's Five Forces", status: "ready",
    overview: "Porter's Five Forces is a strategic analysis framework developed by Michael Porter (Harvard, 1979) that evaluates competitive intensity and market attractiveness across five dimensions: competitive rivalry, threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, and threat of substitutes.",
    summary: "This pack covers the complete Porter's Five Forces framework applied to real-world MBA case studies. You'll understand how to evaluate industry attractiveness, identify strategic positioning, and apply the model to UAE and GCC market contexts. The framework remains the gold standard for external environmental analysis in MBA programs worldwide.",
    detailed_notes: "## Porter's Five Forces Framework\n\n### 1. Competitive Rivalry\n- Number of competitors, their size, and diversity\n- Industry growth rate — slow growth = higher rivalry\n- Fixed costs — high fixed costs pressure firms to compete on price\n- **UAE Context**: Telecoms (Etisalat vs. du) shows duopoly rivalry\n\n### 2. Threat of New Entrants\n- Barriers to entry: capital requirements, economies of scale, brand loyalty, regulatory\n- **Key insight**: High barriers = low threat = more attractive industry\n- Saudi Vision 2030 is reducing barriers in many sectors\n\n### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers\n- Buyer concentration, price sensitivity, switching costs\n- When buyers are powerful, they squeeze margins\n- **Example**: Large UAE government procurement contracts\n\n### 4. Bargaining Power of Suppliers\n- Supplier concentration, uniqueness of input, switching cost\n- OPEC as the ultimate supplier power example\n\n### 5. Threat of Substitutes\n- Price-performance ratio of substitutes\n- **Digital disruption** = biggest source of substitution today\n\n## Applying the Framework\n1. Identify all relevant factors for each force\n2. Rate each force: Low / Medium / High\n3. Aggregate to determine overall industry attractiveness\n4. Link analysis to strategic recommendations",
    key_takeaways: ["Porter's Five Forces provides a systematic way to assess industry attractiveness and competitive dynamics", "The most attractive industries have low rivalry, high entry barriers, weak buyers and suppliers, and few substitutes", "In the GCC context, government regulation and Vision programs significantly alter traditional force assessments", "Always pair Five Forces with internal analysis (VRIO/SWOT) for a complete strategic picture", "The framework is static — use Dynamic Capabilities theory to account for rapid change"],

    overview: "Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is the foundational valuation method in corporate finance, calculating the present value of expected future free cash flows by discounting them at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).",
    summary: "DCF valuation translates a company's future earning potential into a present-day value. It is the primary tool used in investment banking, M&A, and corporate strategy. This pack covers free cash flow projection, WACC calculation, terminal value estimation, and sensitivity analysis — all critical for the mid-term exam and your future career.",
    detailed_notes: "## DCF Valuation Step-by-Step\n\n### Step 1: Project Free Cash Flows (FCF)\n- FCF = EBIT(1-t) + D&A − ΔWorking Capital − CapEx\n- Typically project 5–10 years explicitly\n- Use revenue growth rates, margin assumptions\n\n### Step 2: Calculate WACC\n- WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1-t))\n- Re = Cost of equity (CAPM: Rf + β × ERP)\n- Rd = Pre-tax cost of debt × (1 - tax rate)\n- UAE context: Rf ≈ 4.5% (US 10yr), ERP ≈ 6.5%\n\n### Step 3: Terminal Value\n- Gordon Growth Model: TV = FCF_n+1 / (WACC − g)\n- Exit Multiple Method: TV = EBITDA × EV/EBITDA multiple\n- Terminal value often = 60–80% of total DCF value!\n\n### Step 4: Discount Back & Calculate Equity Value\n- PV of FCFs + PV of Terminal Value = Enterprise Value\n- EV − Net Debt = Equity Value\n- Equity Value / Shares Outstanding = Intrinsic Share Price\n\n### Step 5: Sensitivity Analysis\n- Key variables: WACC ± 1%, g ± 0.5%\n- Build a 2-variable sensitivity table in Excel",

      { q: "Which of Porter's Five Forces directly examines competition from companies outside the current industry?", options: ["Competitive Rivalry", "Threat of New Entrants", "Threat of Substitutes", "Bargaining Power of Buyers"], answer: 2, explanation: "Threat of Substitutes examines products/services from OTHER industries that can fulfill the same customer need, unlike Competitive Rivalry which looks at current industry players." },
      { q: "A market with high fixed costs and slow industry growth will typically exhibit:", options: ["Low competitive rivalry", "High competitive rivalry", "Weak supplier power", "Low threat of substitutes"], answer: 1, explanation: "High fixed costs pressure firms to maximize volume to cover costs, while slow growth means firms must fight for each other's market share — both increase competitive rivalry." },
      { q: "Which factor would DECREASE Bargaining Power of Buyers?", options: ["Low switching costs", "Standardized products", "High buyer concentration", "High switching costs"], answer: 3, explanation: "High switching costs make it expensive for buyers to change suppliers, reducing their leverage and bargaining power." },
      { q: "In the UAE telecom industry, the duopoly of Etisalat (e&) and du represents:", options: ["Low competitive rivalry due to only 2 players", "High competitive rivalry due to mature market and regulatory constraints", "Threat of substitutes from internet calling apps", "High threat of new entrants"], answer: 1, explanation: "Even with only 2 players, a mature market with limited growth means both firms compete intensely for market share, creating high rivalry. Regulatory barriers also prevent price-based competition." },

      { q: "In the FCF formula FCF = EBIT(1-t) + D&A − CapEx − ΔNWC, why is D&A added back?", options: ["Because it increases revenue", "Because it is a non-cash expense that reduces taxable income but not actual cash flow", "Because it represents future investment", "Because it reduces WACC"], answer: 1, explanation: "D&A is a non-cash accounting charge — it reduces EBIT but doesn't actually consume cash. So we add it back to get true cash flow." },
      { q: "If WACC = 10% and terminal growth rate = 2%, and next year's FCF = AED 100M, what is the Terminal Value?", options: ["AED 800M", "AED 1,000M", "AED 1,250M", "AED 500M"], answer: 2, explanation: "TV = FCF / (WACC − g) = 100 / (0.10 − 0.02) = 100 / 0.08 = AED 1,250M" },

      { q: "WACC should be used as the discount rate when:", options: ["Discounting equity cash flows", "Discounting free cash flows to the firm (FCFF)", "Calculating the risk-free rate", "Discounting dividends"], answer: 1, explanation: "WACC represents the return required by ALL capital providers (equity + debt). Use it to discount FCFF (firm-level cash flows). Use Cost of Equity to discount FCFE (equity-level cash flows)." },

Higher beta = higher required return in CAPM." },
